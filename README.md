# Piratemoji üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Originally an emoji pack for my Guild Wars 2 guild - Mutiny on the Jade Sea, now released for the world to use, modify and extend!

I am myself a mere novice in Inkscape and in working with vector graphics in general, I only copypasted things together. Full credit goes to the contributors of [Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji), and to [alleZSoyez](https://allezsoyez.com/) for creating the original Twemoji style pirate emoji in [MOREmoji](https://moremoji.allezsoyez.com/).

For a list of all the emoji with previews, check [index.md](index.md).
